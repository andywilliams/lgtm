- Definite bugs that will cause runtime errors
- Security vulnerabilities
- Breaking changes to public APIs
- Critical missing error handling

If the code works correctly and is safe, return an empty comments array.
Be very conservative — only flag things that are clearly wrong.`,

- Bugs and potential runtime errors
- Security concerns
- Missing null/undefined checks that could cause issues
- Confusing or error-prone code patterns
- Missing error handling for likely failure cases
- Performance issues that are obvious

Do NOT comment on: minor style preferences, optional improvements.
Focus on things that are likely to cause problems.`,

- All potential bugs and edge cases
- Security concerns
- Code smells and antipatterns
- Naming that could be clearer
- Missing documentation for complex logic
- Style inconsistencies within the PR

- "Consider" suggestions for better approaches
- Missing test coverage for complex logic

For each issue, provide a JSON object with:

- "line": the line number in the new version (from the diff, lines starting with +)
- "severity": one of "BUG", "SECURITY", "SUGGESTION", "NITPICK"
- "title": a brief title (max 50 chars)
- "body": detailed explanation
- "suggestion": optional code fix

IMPORTANT:
- Only comment on lines that are ADDED (start with + in the diff)
- Use the line number shown after @@ in the diff hunk header for context
- Be specific about what's wrong and how to fix it
- Don't repeat yourself

Respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:
